title: White paper draft is ready
---

The Laminar white paper draft is finally ready to be subject to broader scrutiny:  [https://github.com/jmdisher/Laminar/wiki/Draft-White-Paper](https://github.com/jmdisher/Laminar/wiki/Draft-White-Paper)

The only information missing is the references and acknowledgements, which will be added once content and structure have been checked for usefulness and consumability.

Of course, any incorrect statements will also need to be fixed but, given that this is mostly just introducing/describing the project, my main concern is with how easily it can be understood.

Next step is probably to figure out if I can get the ClientLib setup as a Maven artifact directly accessible from GitHub and maybe make some other small changes but the project is effectively "done", barring any new interest in deploying it.
